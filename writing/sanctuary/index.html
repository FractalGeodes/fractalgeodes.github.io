      <p>
        Abigail has forgotten the last time that she wrote anything. She has
        forgotten the last time that she ate three decent meals in a single day.
        She has forgotten the last time that she managed to get a satisfactory
        amount of chores done.
      </p>
      <p>
        She has forgotten the last time that she went a day without having a
        headache after a collision with the wall. Or with her hand. Or with
        something blunt <em>in</em> her hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her head down on her desk, she wishes that she could cry. She wishes
        that the tears would well up, and that she could just let it all out. It
        feels like it&#39;s not even bad enough if she&#39;s not crying. It
        feels like she&#39;s just being selfish if she&#39;s not crying. It
        feels awful that she can&#39;t cry. She feels worthless, she feels numb,
        she feels null. She doesn&#39;t want to <em>feel</em> anymore. She
        doesn&#39;t want to die, but she just wants. A break. She wants a break.
        From having to persist. From having to exist. From having to hate
        herself all the time.
      </p>
      <p>She wishes she was just. <em>Elsewhere</em>.</p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        The Caretaker is jolted awake. It grumbles. It was having quite a nice
        sleep before being <em>rudely</em> awoken.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though, its accipients cannot help it. They aren&#39;t ever aware of
        what is happening to them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regardless, it should get itself ready. It pulls open the wardrobe and
        starts to sift through it.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Abigail has fallen asleep at her computer. She is dreaming. Dreaming of
        a comfortable place. Dreaming of a place where she is cared for, and can
        heal. At least she. Thinks. That&#39;s... what this means. What else
        could the feeling of lying face-down on a sofa in a room
        <em>just</em> the right temperature be?
      </p>
      <p>
        She then realises that she knows she&#39;s dreaming. Which is. Not
        normal. Is she lucid dreaming? Why can&#39;t she see anything. Why is
        the smell and the feeling of the blanket over top of her- why is there a
        blanket? Is she awake? Did someone find her and put a blanket over her?
        No, she doesn&#39;t live with anyone, how could that happen. What-
      </p>
      <p>&quot;Hello?&quot;</p>
      <p>
        Abigail jolts up. She&#39;d swear if she wasn&#39;t still so lethargic.
        She can barely comprehend anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        In front of her is a figure. They stand tall- no, are they floating off
        the ground slightly? They wear a long robe with pale hair, which seems
        to flow a bit in the... wind? Abigail doesn&#39;t feel any wind, though?
        Why is there wind? Aren&#39;t they indoors?
      </p>
      <p>
        The figure in front of her speaks, their voice soft, careful, yet strong
        in her ears and almost ethereal.<br />&quot;Oh, I woke you? I am
        sorry.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        Abigail tries to ask &quot;Who the fuck are you, where am I?&quot; but
        she ends up stumbling over her words. She still feels so tired. Is she
        dreaming? She was dreaming right? Did she establish that before?
      </p>
      <p>
        Surprisingly, she gets a response.<br />&quot;You are,&quot;<br />The
        figure pauses for a moment, before speaking.<br />&quot;You are in
        <em>Sanctuary</em>.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        Abigail understands, but something feels. Off. She knows what
        &quot;Sanctuary&quot; is, like she&#39;s known it her whole life. But
        she doesn&#39;t feel like she should. Also, she could have sworn that
        the woman in her, admittedly blurry vision, did <em>not</em> say
        Sanctuary. The figure said something else, Abigail is sure. But it&#39;s
        like her brain corrected it for her?
      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;Oh, do not worry about that right now. You are far too
        tired.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, right, she <em>is</em> tired. She needs a coffee. She places a hand
        on the side of the sofa to get up, before realising that her hand is
        very close to a very hot mug.
      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;Sorry, I did not have time to put a cupholder in it, so be
        careful. Here, I can help you up if you want.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        Abigail <em>wants</em> to deny being touched by the weird tall floating
        woman right now but she is too fucking tired to think about
        <em>anything</em> in this situation and she&#39;s dreaming anyway so
        might as well roll with it at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
        The figure very gently grabs hold of Abigail&#39;s sides and straightens
        her up on the sofa. They&#39;re very gentle when touching her. Abigail
        appreciates that. She&#39;s not quite used to being touched. They hand
        her the drink, and she takes it after <em>attempting to</em> fixing up
        the blankets around her lap.
      </p>
      <hr id="may9update"/>
      <p>
        It sifts through memories of the accipient&#39;s past, and their,
        <em>her</em>, pasts adjacent. A sprawling web of strings and outcomes,
        some tangled, some isolated, spiralling off into the distance, a few
        eventually splitting off further. Some cut short, others frayed at the
        ends. Some are long, vast, fulfilled. All of them tied to one origin
        point, which too would no doubt lead back to another web of lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        But that is not of its concern. The Caretaker owes itself only to its
        accipient, the woman sitting in front of it right now. Abigail.
      </p>
      <p>
        Speaking of her, she is much more present than before, which is good. As
        easy as it is to maintain the suspension of someone still teetering on
        the edge of lucidity, it is a lot easier to converse with someone who is
        aware of their surroundings. The Caretaker knows <em>that</em> from
        experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;You are feeling better.&quot; It says, very matter-of-factly,
        still trying to maintain its softer tone.<br />Abigail looks up from her
        mug.<br />She makes a soft sound of agreement.<br />&quot;More
        lucid?&quot; The Caretaker adds.<br />Abigail gives a gentle nod in
        response. She is still obviously tired, but is awake enough for coherent
        thought.
      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;I am sure that you have many questions. I will do my best to
        answer them.&quot;<br />The Caretaker <em>could</em> just answer every
        single question that Abigail has right now, but it&#39;s courteous to
        let someone speak for themselves in these kinds of situations. It cannot
        get away with answering private thoughts now that Abigail is lucid
        enough to catch on.
      </p>
      <p>
        It watches as she sits in thought, pondering the questions that she has.
        She eventually picks one to start with.<br />&quot;I&#39;m not...
        asleep, am I?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        That is one of the more difficult questions to answer. It takes an
        almost perceptible moment for it to formulate its answer.<br />&quot;The
        straightforward answer is that, no, you <em>are</em> asleep. What you
        would regard as &#39;you&#39; is currently asleep at your desk. You have
        been asleep for less than a few minutes.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        Abigail nods receptively, and follows up immediately with &quot;Am I
        dreaming?&quot;<br /><em>That</em>, the Caretaker can answer
        objectively: &quot;No, you are not. Your being has been summoned to a
        place beyond what you would call your own reality.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        This warrants a blank stare from the accipient.<br />The Caretaker takes
        a step backwards. &quot;Apologies, let me explain more thoroughly. Your
        being is one of many different possibilities. Permutations and
        alterations, forming a fractaline web of all possible variations of
        <em>you</em>.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;Currently,&quot; it continues, &quot;your being has been taken
        from one of these branches, and moved into a place that exists outside
        of this tapestry. I am here to facilitate your staying here for as long
        as you need.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        The Caretaker brings its focus back to Abigail, who is sitting and
        contemplating. Luckily, she also seems to be understanding, which is the
        more difficult part of this, at least in its experience.
      </p>
      <p>She has one final question.</p>
      <p>&quot;Why?&quot;</p>
      <p>
        The Caretaker mimics taking a deep breath. It had picked that up as a
        habit from a prior accipient.
      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;You wanted a break. That is as much as I will say. The purpose of
        you being here is not something that I know of, despite what I do know.
        It is something you will need to discover. I will be here to help you
        along that journey.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        Abigail, having finished her coffee, flops back down onto the couch.<br />&quot;I...&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        She needs some time to think. The Caretaker can allow her that. It needs
        to assemble some notes, regardless.
      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;I will allow you some time to collect your thoughts. Feel free to
        look around the room, as well.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;I--&quot;<br />The accipient stares that the ceiling.<br />&quot;Okay.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;...One more thing.&quot;<br />&quot;Yes?&quot;<br />&quot;What&#39;s
        your name?&quot;
      </p>
